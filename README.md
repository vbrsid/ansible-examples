# ansible-examples

This repo has multiple examples on Ansible and each one is complete by itself. Each one provides an example how a specific module in Ansible can be used. Some of the examples help understand the features of Ansible like 'loops' and storing variables in 'register' output. 

These examples are tested with version 2.12.1 of Ansible on Mac. Make sure that the python version in the path and python version used by Ansible are of the same version. In my case, they both are 3.10.1.
